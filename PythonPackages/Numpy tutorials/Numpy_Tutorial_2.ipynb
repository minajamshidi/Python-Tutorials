    "# Playing with Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, I tried to include questions that help a Python beginner to get started with Numpy. I believe this notebook is mostly like a play ground for a beginner to play with numpy functions and explore this important Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know there are many Numpy notebooks out there, but I would say the advantage of this notebook over other notebooks I saw is that I prepared the questions looking back at the time I was learning Python and Numpy. Therefore, the questions are based on the practical points that I came across during my self-learning of Python - not as a professional Python programmer who wants to teach others. Therefore, the structure of the notebook seems a bit messy and like a self-taught learner's notebook, which I don't find a negative aspect and I kind of intentionally prepared the questions in this direction. Because, I find self-learning the best practice of learning programming. One should get hands dirty and play with functions. This notebook can guide a Python beginner to learn Numpy by self-learning! If you are interested to use this notebook as your play ground, I suggest you not to look at the answers and write your own by googling. Google is the best source of learning programming. Look at this notebook as a source of what to google!\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is not very coherent since it was not prepared for a systematic workshop, but I just prepared it for a friend.\n",

I guess, the answer of almost all of your questions can be found in our previous practice excercises. However, you may not find those answers (don't worry), these potential errors are very specific AND common. We can always go through the questions with each other. :-)\n",
