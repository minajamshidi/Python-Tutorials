    "# Playing with Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, I tried to include questions that help a Python beginner to get started with Numpy. I believe this notebook is mostly like a play ground for a beginner to play with numpy functions and explore this important Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know there are many Numpy notebooks out there, but I would say the advantage of this notebook over other notebooks I saw is that I prepared the questions looking back at the time I was learning Python and Numpy. Therefore, the questions are based on the practical points that I came across during my self-learning of Python - not as a professional Python programmer who wants to teach others. Therefore, the structure of the notebook seems a bit messy and like a self-taught learner's notebook, which I don't find a negative aspect and I kind of intentionally prepared the questions in this direction. Because, I find self-learning the best practice of learning programming. One should get hands dirty and play with functions. This notebook can guide a Python beginner to learn Numpy by self-learning! If you are interested to use this notebook as your play ground, I suggest you not to look at the answers and write your own by googling. Google is the best source of learning programming. Look at this notebook as a source of what to google!\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is not very coherent since it was not prepared for a systematic workshop, but I just prepared it for a friend. However, at some point I started to include some explanations, which makes it easier to use the notebook for a beginner. For other occasions, I included some links to useful websites where one can read the concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "(C) Prepared by Mina Jamshidi (https://github.com/minajamshidi) (2020). Note that Ehsan Khorsandnejad initially arranged this notebook and wrote the codes as answers to the questions. I modified the notebook only slightly later."

    "In order to be able to use different features of Python, it is necessary to install and import the relevant packages. For example, the package `numpy` can be used to work with matrices in Python. Importing a package is quite simple. We use `import` to import the package and also use `as` to give it a name. Each package has its own functions. To use this functions later in the code, it is necessary to use the following format `np.` + `name of the function`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may simply import the package by `import [PackageName]`, for example `import numpy`. In this case, the package does not have a *nickname* (e.g. `np`) any more. You should call it ny its original name, for example `numpy.[FunctionName]`. We usually do this when the package name is already a short one.\n",
    "There are cases that you want to use a function of a package directly in your code. In such a case, you should import the function directly by writing `from [PackageName] import [FunctionName]`. For example, `from numpy import pi` can be used when you want to use `pi` instead of `np.pi`. This practice is used when you use a function multiple times in your code, or when you do not need all the functions of a package, but only a couple of them. Another example of importing multiple funtions from a package: `from numpy import pi, dot, mean`. We tend to import the whole package; however, a more professional way is to import only the functions that we need - if they are not many. "

This good practice becomes important when a vale is repeated through lines of codes and it could get arbitrary values each time. Another reason for using this practice is that your code is more readable because parameters can have descriptions and then when they appear in the code it is clear what they mean, while values do not have this descripttion. Another example is when you have a tolerance in your code, let's say you do something until an estimated error is smaller than some tolerance value, say $0.001$. You may write code like this:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    while error > 0.001:\n",
    "        # Do something and calculate error\n",
    "    \n",
    "or like the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    tol = 0.001 # tolerance\n",
    "    while error > tol:\n",
    "        # Do something and calculate error\n",
    "    \n",
    "The latter is more clear for a reader because `tol` has a description and he/she undestands that this `tol` value is kind of arbitrary. \n",
    "\n",
    "P.S.\n",

    "* Values are saved with `0` and `1` in the memory (binary system). So, each integer is represented by some bits in the memory. For example 2 is `10`$=0 + 1\\times 2$ or 3 is `11`$=1 + 1\\times 2$ or 10 is `1010`$=0 + 1\\times 2 + 0\\times 2^2 + 1\\times 2^3$. So, if you have for example 3 bits, the maximum value you can build is `111`$=1 + 1\\times 2 + 1\\times 2^2 = 7 = 2^3 - 1$. You can conclude that with $n$ bits, the maximum *unsigned* value that we can have is $2^n - 1$. Please pay attention to *unsigned* word: if the integer is *signed* (i.e. it can be negative or positive), then the leftmost bit is allocated to the sign and then we have only $n-1$ bits for the value. Therefore, the largest value is $2^{n-1}-1$ and the smallest value is $-2^{n-1}$. (why minimum negative value is $-2^{n-1}$? You can google sth like \"negative numbers in binary\".)   \n",

If we add one to this value in the binary system it will be `10000000` which is equal to $=-128=-2^7$. At this point we have already exceeded the maximum allowed value which was $127$. This bahaviour is called overflow. If we further add one to this value in the binary system it will be `10000001`=$-127=-2^7 + 1$. This can continue until `11111111`=$-1$  \n",

This hints us that the size of the integer was 64 bits and signed: the maximum value was $2^{63}-1$. Therefore, when you request python to compute $2^{63}$, it puts `1` at the leftmost bit and `0` at all other bits which is translated to that large negative value (remember that for signed integers the leftmost bit is for sign). Then, since $2^{64}$ is `10...00` with 65 bits, in a 64-bit system, only the 64 right-most bits are taken, which are all zero. Therefore, $2^{64}$ is represented as `0` in a 64-bit binary system.
