In this forlder I include the tutorials I prepared for learning Numpy.

In these tutorials, I tried to include questions that help a Python beginner to get started with Numpy. I believe these notebooks are mostly like a play ground for a beginner to play with numpy functions and explore this important Python package.

I know there are many Numpy notebooks out there, but I would say the advantage of these notebooks over other notebooks I saw is that I prepared the questions looking back at the time I was learning Python and Numpy. Therefore, the questions are based on the practical points that I came across during my self-learning of Python - not as a professional Python programmer who wants to teach others. Therefore, the structure of the notebooks seems a bit messy and like a self-taught learner's notebook, which I don't find a negative aspect and I kind of intentionally prepared the questions in this direction. Because I find self-learning the best practice of learning programming. One should get hands dirty and play with functions. These notebooks can guide a Python beginner to learn Numpy by self-learning! If you are interested to use these notebooks as your play ground, I suggest you not to look at the answers and write your own by googling. Google is the best source of learning programming. Look at these notebooks as a source of what to google!

The notebooks are not very coherent since they were not prepared for a systematic workshop, but I just prepared them for a friend.
