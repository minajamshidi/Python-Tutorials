This folder includes an EEG preprocessing jupyter notebook that I prepared for the course "Methods in Cognitive Neuroscience" at Max Planck School of Cognition, June 2020.

* Note: You won't find the saved raw files and ICA computation results in this repository. In case you are interested in going through this tutorial, I believe you can generate them by yourself. Otherwise, you can contact me to provide you with them :-)
